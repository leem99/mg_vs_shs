This repo contains materials for an academic paper Mitchell Lee is working on. 
The goal of the paper is to use SharedSolar data in order to compare the cost 
of micro-grids to Solar Home Systems. 

Micro-grid simulations are conducted in HOMER.

Underlying data comes from sharedsolar@data.sharedsolar.org

To learn more about the data synthesis process go to:

Steps taken to convert data on sharedsolar@data.sharedsolar.org
into HOMER readable files are in /mg_vs_shs/python
